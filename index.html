            <h2>The biggest universities worldwide</h2>
            <p>
                The following are the biggest universities worldwide for enrolled students:<br>
                1. Indira Gandhi National Open University, India
                 The Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) is a Central Open Learning 
                 University in Indiaâ€™s capital city of New Delhi, located in the neighborhood
                 of Maidan Garhi. It was founded in 1985 with a funding of 20 million rupees
                 after the Indian Parliament passed the Indira Gandhi National Open University
                 Act, 1985, in her honor (IGNOU Act 1985).IGNOU, managed by the Indian government,
                 claims to be the biggest university in the world because it currently has more
                 than 4 million enrolled students. Open and distance education are the most common 
                 means of instruction. 
                 As part of its mission, Indira Gandhi National Open actively supports academic
                 inquiry, classroom instruction, community outreach, and faculty development.
                 In addition to opening its first regional headquarters in Kerala, the university 
                 has future plans to open additional regional headquarters in other areas so that
                 it can serve an even larger student body.</p><br>

                    <p> IGNOU degree is equivalent to a regular degree in terms of 
                        its academic rigor and recognition by regulatory bodies such 
                        as the UGC. However, since IGNOU offers distance learning programs,
                        ts degrees may be perceived differently by employers or other institutions.</p>

                <h2>Advantages Of a large Classroom</h2>
                <p>
                    Because core lessons take longer to complete, filler lessons that students
                     dislike rarely happen. In addition, students must learn independence and 
                     self-motivation because teachers have less time to work one-on-one with
                    students.Peer to peer learning. Sometimes it's the people we study with
                     who can teach us the most. .</p>

                <p>Play improves the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being 
                    of children and young people. Through play, children learn about the
                     world and themselves. They also learn skills they need for study, work 
                     and relationships such as: confidence.</p>

                            <p>Donâ€™t do it. Do not join IGNOU. Iâ€™m a BCA student and here are
                                the reasons not to join IGNOU:-
                                Website User Interface is crap. Its very hard to search information 
                                from the website.Considering you joined Open University you expect a
                                Good informative website.
                                Iâ€™m in BCA so itâ€™s a BCA point, Study material of Mathematics and 
                                Computer languages are poorly documented. Other Subject like English
                                etc are well documented btw.</p>

                                 centre. In my point of view, IGNOU has good study material and if we 
                                 study it well ( in detail) then we can easily get good marks. I used 
                                 to watch You Tube to understand concepts that I had difficulty in understanding 
                                 as concepts are sometimes not in much detail. I used to watch IIT channels on You 
                                 Tube. Sometimes, My doubts about some topics were not even cleared by the faculty</p>

                                i am in last semester but frustrated from the process. None 
                                of the faculty member from your regional center as well as 
                                study centre will help you to answer yours queries. You have 
                                to suppose everything at your own and act accordingly. If you 
                                ask anything regarding your assignment submission as well as 
                                lab courses, your study centre will simply say to ask it from 
                                regional centre. And our great regional centres.

                 is a country full of opportunities and there is no limit to what one
                 can achieve. 
                 But with all these unlimited opportunities, comes the extensive competition
                 present in the country. Yes, itâ€™s not a hidden fact that everyone in India 
                 faces the problem of extensive competitiveness and while some healthy competition 
                 needs to be there, there arises a need to stand out from the competition. 

                 To excel in your professional career, it is useful to specialize in varied 
                 areas and learn as many skills as possible and thatâ€™s where certification 
                 courses come in handy.
